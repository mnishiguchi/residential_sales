Residential sales
=================

In this repository, I will study data visualization in Rails. This app is a sample app from the book [Data Visualization Toolkit: Using JavaScript, Rails, and Postgres to Present Data and Geospatial Information](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualization-Toolkit-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0134464435) by Barrett Clark
